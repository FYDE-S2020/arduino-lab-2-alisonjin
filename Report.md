## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

   To give each device a unique identity so that they can each be identified while connected to a network.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    DNS stands for Domain Name Service which connects IP addresses to symbolic names i.e. URLs. Domain names are easier to remember compared to the IP addresses.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

   Dynamic IPs change every time a device connects to the Internet while static IPs remain the same.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    TCP gives more reliable connection while UDP gives connection with emphasis on speed and not reliability.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Blynk is event based so a delay would mess up the activation of event triggers.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    It's like blocking out time only for that function. Nothing else can run while it's running.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    Because you can run multiple things at once since the ESP32 automatically outputs PWM signals to every pin.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   An interface defines how to call the function while implementation defines what the function actually does. This is important because Blynk provides how you have to call the functions but the user can define what actually will happen.
